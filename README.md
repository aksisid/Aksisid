## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in a Molecular Biology on my PhD. My thesis is on the interaction between Cardiovascular Diseases and Autoinflammatory diseases. More specifically, we are trying to understand the effect of high triglyceride levels on rheumatoid arthritis working on a hypertriglyceridemic mouse model.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to programming and use bioinformatic tools (on Python and R) to expand not only my research but also the questions I can answer. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting better in Linux systems and Bash language. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you believe I can help you. I like to share knowledge.
